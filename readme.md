### Setup

This site runs on [roots v3](https://github.com/jenius/roots/tree/v3), which you can install using the command `npm i roots@pre -g`, assuming you have a recent version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.

To get this project running locally:

- Clone the repo down and `cd` into it
- Run `npm i`
- Run `roots watch`

You should see a development version open up in your browser that you can hack on.
